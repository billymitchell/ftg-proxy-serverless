The app is a proxy server that uses serverless functions to interact with Airtable. It provides two main endpoints:

GET /api/redemption-code-status/:redemptionCode – Retrieves the status of a specific redemption code by querying Airtable and storing the result in a cache (api/redemption-code-status/[redemptionCode].js).
POST /api/order-data – Processes incoming order data by extracting redemption codes from order items, updating their status in Airtable, and caching the update (api/order-data.js).
It leverages environment variables from the .env file, uses caching via cache.js, and interacts with Airtable through functions in airtable.js.
